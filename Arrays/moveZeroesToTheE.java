/*
Traverse the array, and whenever you find a non-zero element, place it in the next available position in the array.
After youâ€™ve moved all the non-zero elements, fill the remaining positions in the array with zeroes.
Explanation:
First loop: We iterate through the array. If a non-zero element is found, it is placed in the next available position at index, and index is incremented.
Second loop: After all non-zero elements have been moved, the remaining positions (from index to the end of the array) are filled with zeroes.
